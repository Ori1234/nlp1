Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.
I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.
The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.
This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.
(Applause from the PSE Group)
It is not a lot to ask.
Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.
There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.
In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation.
I have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºC.
Hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions.
The debate is closed.
Mr President, it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the European Parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the United Kingdom that I represent in this Parliament, namely Wales.
We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality.
This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs.
It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.
I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines.
The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration.
It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes.
Mr President, Commissioner, as proof that this Parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution, the excellent report by a fellow member of my Group, Elisabeth Schroedter, has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000-2006 for Objective 1 regions have been sitting in the Commission' s offices for several months.
This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain.
In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best.
It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty.
Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable.
In this respect, I am pleased to see that the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the Commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and, more specifically, to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new Article 299(2) of the Treaty of Amsterdam.
The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment.
Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
Finally, I would like to draw attention to the position of the Central and Eastern European countries.
Mr President, Commissioner, following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part.
I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official.
Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006.
On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself.
Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns.
(The sitting was closed at 8.25 p.m.)
Thank you very much.
This is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code.
We all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency, and I believe we should also permit competition in the regions.
Apart from that, I could refer to any customers, any sector, as customers, and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields.
Mr President, Commissioner, I want to begin by thanking Mr Rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation.
Workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights.
Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy.
Finally, we, as British Conservatives, are looking for a change in direction, towards the development of an independent competition authority.
This is unacceptable in my view.
In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties.
Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers.
Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code.
State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.
Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules.
Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal.
There have only been nine rejections.
It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference.
I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past.
The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed.
This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office.
In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established.
The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one.
Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda.
The Tampere Summit was about combating crime.
I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same.
I believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the European Union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as European criminal offences - we have become embroiled in legalities.
We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate.
Recommendation for second reading (A5-0105/1999), on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)) (Rapporteur: Mr Koch)
Some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation.
While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem.
I take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in Europe appear to be falling.
Admittedly, this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling.
Curiously, a number of employers agreed with them, preferring the European "one-stop" system, which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally.
In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future.
The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully.
So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion.
Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters.
Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, so many names we remember with horror.
It should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial, but include materials testing.
However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented.
On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience.
I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future.
However, it seems that none of the Member States meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors.
These timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in Member States.
However, I come from an area in Northern Germany where the forestry industry predominates and I can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage.
The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past.
Sometimes within the Community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries.
So I ask that Ireland be remembered in this particular case.
I would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the European institutions, including the Commission and Parliament.
Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003?
In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board.
It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment.
When will the Commission appoint a Special Envoy for Tibet?
As it happens, we deal with the budgetary consequences, the Council makes the appointment.
It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member.
We do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved.
So what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups, between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences; that is mainly what we are looking for, and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated.
Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.
These discussions have already started, but we will need to take account of the results in Lisbon.
That is dealt with either under special programmes in education, for young people, for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy.
The second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the Commission, in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts.
We are all very much anticipating this, but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge.
We think it is wrong to talk about the Commission' s liability as an institution. The mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time, and we still have no way of knowing whether the new Commission can do any better.
For it is the third section of Mrs van der Laan' s report that is the most important, to my mind, namely the motion for a resolution.
We will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency, transparency and accountability, and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information, are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority.
I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents.
Now we come to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last September.
Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr van Hulten.
After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report.
Just as the White Paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated, we would request the same in connection with the new White Paper on the reform of the Commission.
It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use.
If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed.
After the resignation of a Commission and after a Committee of Experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies, it makes sense that Mr Prodi should have promised, on 14 September, to present this Parliament with a complete plan for reform by February.
I do not know your exact view in this respect, Mr Kinnock, but it is clear that we want Commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed.
There are too many rights, too many regulations and too little room for leadership.
The business of the European Commission is very little about spending money.
A very important proposal indeed.
On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes.
Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report.
I take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying preoccupation of honourable Members is that there should be a carefully managed transition.
Standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the House.
The Commission is actively involved in those efforts.
But this also serves to make a claim, on the part of the European Union, for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be bankers - and which will be suitably visible to the public.
I should also draw your attention to the significance of the Barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation.
Indeed, the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability.
I should really like to stress the excellent role which Mr Moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there, Commissioner Patten.
Like other Arab countries before them, the Syrians chose the Americans to sponsor the negotiations.
So it is with some pride and satisfaction that I find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this House.
However, we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium, so as to give a fresh impetus, while preserving continuity, to the work done under the previous action plan.
The planned introduction of Eurojust is one of our significant successes from Tampere and must now be implemented forthwith.
Generally, they too are elected Members of Parliament: Mr Gomes, Mr Costa, Commissioner Vitorino, in principle we are all in the same boat.
I was also encouraged by Commissioner Patten' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises.
On the other hand, quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life.
They were treated like the worst criminals.
The level of racism in our society is terrifying.
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship.
Although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future, these plans do nothing to improve human rights, civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned.
But I want to add a word of caution.
Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible.
The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented.
This is undeniable, even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts, for reasons beyond Mr Kouchner' s control, have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be.
Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future.
I thank the President-in-Office for his reply.
The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited.
I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency.
We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union.
We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency.
Please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on European affairs.
I cannot think of a better way to do it.
I am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the GUE/NGL, Greens/EFA, ELDR and PSE Groups.
The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak.
Put more strongly, in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds, the Tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens.
The initiators of this question do not propose a solution; instead they are calling for a new burden, they are calling for more bureaucracy, for a measure which runs counter to the market mechanisms and they are taking up plenary' s time with an intergroup opinion which excludes the competent parliamentary committee, contrary to several resolutions by Parliament.
The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this.
Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy.
This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south.
That is why this debate is important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism, something profound is happening in Europe today.
I hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the Austrian people.
I shall make three comments on this matter, to illustrate the gravity of the problem.
Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary.
It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration.
We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe.
Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past.
And when that day comes, it is too late.
This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.
He is a dangerous man.
And they must be consistent with similar measures already taken.
It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health.
In those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda.
I thank the Commission for doing that even if, of course, I do not agree with everything the Commission said.
That is all to the good.
Another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside European Union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build European parliamentary democracy.
My group strongly welcomes the IGC and will be contributing to this Treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent.
What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union.
Brussels knows best.
It is, of course, thoroughly Orwellian.
The European Union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade.
Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation.
This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable.
If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered.
So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully.
What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here?
I feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive, and I should like to thank you for taking it.
When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment.
There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports.
That is why he deserves special mention!
If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive.
We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution.
Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow.
I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable.
On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein.
It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied.
What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate.
Mr President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return, with respect for their own heritage and their own culture.
I agree, absolutely. We shall do so.
However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.
I am pleased that Ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend £125 million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector.
I can vouch that I have already received significant interest in the ALTENER programme from my own constituency of Leinster, a significant portion of which falls within Ireland' s only Objective I region.
We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical.
Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate.
I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot.
Culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs; and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy.
Are we doing enough?
It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council.
I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status.
In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries.
Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators.
I ask for your support.
Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it.
That is a basic principle which we must uphold.
We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position.
Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe.
Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force.
Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context.
The manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and/or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost.
In the Member State where I come from, you are talking about 150 Guilders per car.
Mr President, the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars.
I therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability.
So far, we here in Parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now, if the amendments proposed by Mr Florenz and Mr Lange are adopted, we are to become a negative factor for the environment in Europe.
That is quite simply: Who pays?
The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy.
It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product.
It sets in stone one particular model of recycling.
Consequently, consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production.
Mr President, Commissioner, I have asked to speak again so that I can say a few more words at the close of this debate.
Mr President, the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages, mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use, the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials, etc. I think we have tabled a sound proposal.
This is, of course, because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled.
We can deal with it.
However, we obtained a well-balanced common position in July during the Finnish Presidency.
A total of 48 amendments have been tabled.
These concern, for example, the phasing-out of heavy metals, manufacturer' s liability and the requirement for recycling.
There is a danger of Amendments Nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic, tyres and glass.
I shall read it in English, which is the original language of the resolution.
And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes?
Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years.
This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.
(SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference.
It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them.
All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator.
Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings?
In view of the fact that the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning Haider' s party, as well as all the parties throughout Europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted in favour of the compromise resolution. We did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms, in order to show our solidarity with all those in Austria itself who are opposing the Austrian extreme right and its demagoguery.
Resumption of the session
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 3 February 2000.
I can see from your reaction that many of the Members of Parliament have not received the Minutes and clearly you cannot approve Minutes which you have not seen.
It affects not only Romania, but also Yugoslavia and, in fact, the entire Danube basin.
An integrated development policy for all rural areas in the European Union is therefore needed, consisting of the following elements: an integrated, multi-sectoral approach, simplification of administrative procedures, improvement of the partnership between European institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment.
The second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector, so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented. In this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the CAP.
Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here!
This is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks.
However, in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis.
The measures eligible for funding listed in Annex II of strand A do also seem encouraging in this respect.
In reality, however, the Commission communication does not contain a single provision for the Member States with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects.
There must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a Europe of the cities alone.
Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times.
I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive.
The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States.
My group will not be supporting those amendments.
If that is the case, we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times.
EQUAL remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed, which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market.
Rural areas make up over 80% of the EU' s territory and 25% of the population live in them.
Criticism of the previous Commission' s work was particularly severe, legitimately so, with regard to these Technical Assistance Offices.
Therefore I am putting forward these amendments to Parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme.
I agree completely.
I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important.
Another point: the coordination between INTERREG, PHARE, TACIS and MEDA.
As Mr Barnier too pointed out, it is impossible for all the work previously done by external collaborators to be done now by the Commission' s staff.
If it is higher than at the previous elections, it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge.
Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to welcome the presentation of, and the first ever debate on, the Commission' s programme for government - the word President Prodi is so fond of; as I am -for the whole legislature.
We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development.
I suggest to the Commission, as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement, to present a document, that explains the value of enlargement, not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense; a document, like the Cecchini report before the Single Act, that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand, historic challenge facing Europe today.
You must embark on a dialogue with the international community.
Finally, I consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society, although, unfortunately, this is another contradiction.
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.
In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action.
It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed.
The White Paper clearly foreshadows this legislation but for when? You must realise that this process needs to be accelerated.
My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else.
Does "the European integration model as a rich source for global administration" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power?
The European Commission will need to play an important director' s role in this, provided that clear and attainable objectives are in place.
That is transparency.
(Limited applause)
In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget.
The ingredients of this policy are well known. They are the stimulation of public and private investment, increased investment in research, education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise.
I hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the Commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing Agenda 2000.
I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses.
It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard.
I am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture; they create jobs.
You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation.
This is all the more serious, if that is possible - as others have said - bearing in mind that your Commission, Mr Prodi, has to carry out nothing less than a revision or reform of the current common fisheries policy, which you are legally required to do in 2002.
You may draw your own conclusions.
Mrs Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received.
As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever.
I hope that this Community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities.
This is a Europe of regions in which the regions, which are weaker than the nation states, will easily submit to Brussels.
. (FR) Mr Decourrière' s report is not without merit: at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the INTERREG initiative and its role in opening up border regions, it comes out in favour of SMEs in paragraph 16.
We have no intention of giving Brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the Member States, as suggested in recital of the report.
I therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this European Union plan and for it to be further developed.
Nevertheless, new objectives have been included, specifically the financing of the Nature Network 2000, for which all rural regions will be eligible.
It was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of LEADER + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density.
Of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988.
There are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet.
I would simply point out that the Commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection.
What about the BSE test?
We have a new Commission.
If we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future.
Even now, the rivers in Brittany are eutrophying and this is damaging tourism.
Discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north-west of England will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe.
These brushstrokes are indeed very broad.
Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive.
However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines.
But we should not lower our standards too much either.
The common position is not ambitious enough.
What we need is a completely legally binding objective for OSPAR.
We cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment.
The concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture, environment and water resources, and between positive and negative effects, and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on. This concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the Community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that surpasses basic standards, along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income.
As regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and Community levels, which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities.
I am glad a holistic approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality.
The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake.
I have also heard Commissioner Barnier' s clarification of relations and links with the European Parliament during the implementation of this programme.
In reply to your second point on the Court of Justice, we have not yet established our position on the Court of Justice because we were waiting for the Dur report which was published a few days ago.
Generally speaking, there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in Austria. I have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957.
Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and many other members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and even more MEPs in this House know that, on behalf of the Commission, I will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations, in a spirit of transparency.
If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands.
In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be.
We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.
I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.
Mr President, the Commission will be holding negotiations in the future on the accession of Turkey to the European Union.
Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources.
That question calls for reflection, for debate and, if necessary, for action.
My question specifically concerned the reaction of the US Government to the text of the preliminary draft.
I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these.
This is a crucial goal.
Question No 43 by (H-0045/00):
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society?
It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible.
Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.
This Regulation was adopted just last year in Berlin and I will be applying it for the next seven years.
It is, however, interested in official statements and actions.
Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal.
Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion.
Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure.
It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of.
Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine.
Two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic.
In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area.
In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play.
It brings me great joy to witness that the Council now seems to accept this break-through and also wants to bring it to the fore in Lisbon.
In this way, we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges.
Commissioner, the fact that this report is no longer controversial within Parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance.
Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.
Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States.
There is no need at all for supranationalism in this area.
Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe.
I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said.
The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)].
The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3).
Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development.
After the lucid and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both Mr Amado and Mr Nielson, I would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals, not only by Mr Nielson, but by the entire Commission, in order to make the policy coherent as a whole.
I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States.
But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing.
Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied.
The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results.
This is not new.
So there is a whole raft of contradictions.
For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies.
One thing shocked me in the speech of the President-in-Office of the Council.
If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance
. (PT) Mr President, by way of both a conclusion and a summary, I would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate.
We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence.
We are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the Human Rights Commission.
Spurred on by Amnesty International and others, one of the first decisions I took as Governor of Hong Kong was to abolish the death penalty.
We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid.
The New York stage is different from Geneva.
We take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time, but the Commission will not adopt this.
As regards the Commission's position with respect to the amendments tabled by Parliament I wish to confirm what my colleague stated during the debate in this House on Tuesday, 15 February.
- (DE) The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because, in the plenary debate of the previous day, Commissioner Bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding EU accession to the WIPO Treaties.
EQUAL stands for "equality" .
a system for determining pollutants in water is urgently needed;
Opinion of an MEP from the south of Europe: "Nevertheless, this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions".
.
However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision.
However the Union should be seeking, beyond that, to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater.
Public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake, as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species.
The "zero input" and "zero pollution" requirement, including for substances naturally present in water, is not realistic.
Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality.
But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet.
(SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.
That concludes the explanations of vote.
It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed.
The Fifteen need to start work right now, with all the members of the United Nations; we need, at long last, to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position.
Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law.
But I am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this Parliament and that the aforementioned Committee, of which I form part, has not been involved in this.
What of the human rights of the millions of French people who voted for the National Front and who are deprived of any political representation and vilified daily, as they were on Monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes, when the simple expression of justifiably exasperated views by one of our colleagues, Mr Le Pen, is used as a pretext for iniquitous condemnation, in violation of the law and in violation of all notions of justice, fairness and morals, and when attempts are made, in violation of the clearest legislation, to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote, not received as a favour from the government.
Never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed.
These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.
Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human.
I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda.
It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy.
But we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other Members about other countries, notably Indonesia, East Timor, the Moluccas and Burma.
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out.
Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe.
It seems to me that the only people in Malta that want this are the political class, and I shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the Maltese people are the winners.
Now, as regards the Brok report, Cyprus and Malta are the last of the Mediterranean islands, and, unless I am mistaken, the last islands anywhere in Europe which have not acceded to the European Union.
The European Union' s position on this is crystal clear, and I do not think it is worthwhile second-guessing particular phrases in the Council' s conclusions or in any other statement.
If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.
Forgive me Mr Poos.
Nevertheless, we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care, apart from child health.
As I said, we are not making value judgements about specific actions.
This is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future.
We are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise, and we have already begun work on this matter.
In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local. We have extensive services, too.
There have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the Union and the Czech Republic following two European elections and a major new reform of the European Treaties.
I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.
Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed.
Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member.
The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it.
In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success.
In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community.
The next item is the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the recommendation for a Council Decision authorising the Commission to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with FYROM (SEC(1999)1279 - C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121(COS)).
It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding.
With regard to the problems afflicting Macedonia, higher education for the Albanian-speaking citizens deserves our special attention.
What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia?
Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal.
The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course.
We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development.
The region should recognise that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.
We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now.
All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union.
We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement. It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions.
It is a definite and concrete issue.
Parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal, for example in regard to jurisdiction, the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime.
It would also be a betrayal of the people who will be handling the new, unfamiliar notes.
This means that every Member State must guarantee the establishment of effective, adequate penal sanctions, which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision.
In that context, I want to ask the following question of the Commission' s and the Council' s representatives: is the legal basis which has been invoked adequate?
In my view, it is clearly in conflict with, and far exceeds the scope of, Article 34, paragraph 2, point b where a legal basis is established for so-called framework decisions which are binding upon the Member States in regard to the desired objectives, but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation.
On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance.
The current Directive on UCITS has become antiquated and outdated.
The Commission' s proposal takes it as read that OTC derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that UCITS deal in, but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange-rate risks.
I was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous Parliament.
There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings.
I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS.
As far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15% is concerned, I would like to stress that, apart from the fact that this limit is too low, the text does not define the concept of a group. This concept does not exist under European law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice.
Firstly, I am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments.
Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.
By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council.
As far as the second proposal is concerned, I already mentioned that the Commission will take into consideration many amendments.
The Commission has proposed various amendments to this end, all of which aim to systematically restructure the Council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed. The amendments can be summarised as follows: they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence, introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible, and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications, an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various Member States of the Union.
It is the governments of the Member States who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree.
We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.
Mr President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament on the Bonino List, I intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the Committee on Civil Liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf. It is a vote against this report, or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based.
On 14 December 1999, a five year-old boy called Clément was found in a sleeping-car on the Calais-Ventimiglia train, crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother.
He should never have stayed in France, having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences, which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country.
It is not just a question of style.
Other European countries, on the other hand, do not accept confession as sufficient proof of guilt.
The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament.
I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points.
Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS))
Proposal for a joint resolution on the Commission' s 5 year Strategic Programme
The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries).
It would also appear to be in the Union' s interest for all Member States to help protect the euro, especially Sweden, Denmark, the United Kingdom and Greece, which will not be introducing the euro on 1 January 2002.
Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries.
I do, of course, understand the constraints of the moment and I am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure....
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them.
I am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties, opening new prospects for this partnership.
.
(FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War.
They may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force.
It appears that Goodyear in Italy received Italian and European subsidies to the tune of approximately EUR 40 million.
Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant.
Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits.
The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance.
B5-0140/2000 by Mr Dupuis and others, on behalf of the Technical Group of Independent Members - mixed group, on the situation in Kosovo;
I think we should give this some thought.
I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo.
Can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers, who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad?
Flora Brovina' s husband is the guest of Serbian women in Belgrade.
In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers.
Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.
We must establish dialogue with other forces in Angola, be attentive to the appeals of the Angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions, national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war. These can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades.
If people need to move at all, they need to be given a viable alternative.
They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years.
We would ask the Council and the Commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights.
Russia is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and a full member of the Council of Europe and the OSCE, it has been invited to G7 and is a client of the IMF and the World Bank.
This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice.
We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order.
Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes.
The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year.
Danube environmental disaster
The number is huge. They are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply, ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas.
There must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide.
We stand ready to do so.
This is something I favour, but currently as part of a minority in my own Group.
Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products.
This type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations, not just during the summer when we go swimming in the sea, for example, but also during winter when we go to take the air.
This will determine the success of our work.
Depending on the results of this work, a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting-point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives.
Please note that Mr Michel Raymond, Mr Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against this amendment.
One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market.
This should first of all stand for better service.
Most Member States have been putting the brakes on, and I am pleased to note that, in my country, the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago, and that the Belgian postal services and the Belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition.
What exactly do you intend to liberalise?
In this connection I should like to ask one of our Swedish MEPs for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of Sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution.
I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right.
We have just heard Mr McCartin on the subject.
Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance.
We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe.
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question.
The debate is closed.
All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions.
Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money.
I utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society.
Thirdly, we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which, by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people, not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people.
So far, unfortunately, in Spain and France, just the opposite has been happening as regards the on-going conflict in the Basque country.
The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission.
Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks.
That is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the Commission want to provide and will provide.
I do not make this point because of any desire in the Prodi Commission to retreat from activities or responsibilities.
The role of the budgetary authority in the operation of ABM will, therefore, be vital.
I would emphasise, too, that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the Commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to "responsibilise" - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means.
In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances. The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition.
Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate.
Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes.
May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward.
Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe.
It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold.
At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of.
I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example.
You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it.
In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today.
As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
So again, rhetoric and reality.
So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises.
Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say 'How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?' .
We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can' .
Women in the decision-making process
Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves.
It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.
Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense.
We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for.
The EU and some of its Member States, including my own, have provided emergency financial aid, perhaps a little later than they should have, but they have done so, as have the United States and various countries in the region, particularly South Africa.
Although it is currently impossible to calculate how many people have died, we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops.
I must admit that I have my doubts about this.
But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems.
Unless it is restored in its original form by Parliament, accepting the amendments retabled by the Socialist Group, I must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my Socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that Parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience.
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest.
The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with.
I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.
It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro.
We must define a macro-economic policy which aids growth.
These are two of the principal challenges for the Lisbon Summit.
Amendment No 7 calls on the Commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation.
Instead of always following behind the United States, in Seattle, in Kosovo, in Iraq, perhaps the Europe of Brussels could suggest, over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, over and above the regulation of tuna, cod or other things, that Europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing, a kind of Montego Bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity.
Finally, Mr President, as I must be brief given the time constraints, I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work which she has carried out within our committee.
The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms.
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals.
I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424.
I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4.
It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised.
In this respect, important Community initiatives arose from Bergen which have always been supported by our committee. These are aimed at re-establishing the breeding biomass, reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources, protecting juveniles, species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries.
Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made.
At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system.
We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector.
As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.
Bankruptcy procedures
We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner.
How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained?
These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities.
Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand.
So, yes, Total Fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological, economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster.
Mr President, the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick, two and a half months after the wreck of the Erika, is because the extent of the economic, social and ecological disaster affecting our Atlantic coastline is, in fact, far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand.
If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance.
Finally, I would like to highlight the health aspect.
The Erika oil spill is one of a catalogue of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community waters, including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress off Wales.
What we are about to discuss is really very simple: the respect, application and monitoring of the agreements subscribed to by the European Union, and compliance with the Treaties and international standards to which it adheres.
We have repeatedly stated this position to the Israeli authorities at every official meeting between the Commission and the relevant Israeli minister, the most recent of which was held on 21 January. On that occasion, the Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, attended a meeting with Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, and with Commissioner Patten.
In January of this year, the Israeli authorities suggested setting up a tripartite working group comprising representatives of the Palestinian authorities, of the Israeli Government and of the Commission.
Mr President, Commissioner, since the signing of the Oslo Agreements in 1995, Israeli-Palestinian relations have entered a new phase, which should lead to a fair and lasting peace between partners which respect each other.
On one of my many visits to the area, I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting, lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair.
Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal.
Nor have the electorate felt themselves manipulated by such quotas.
We look forward to that.
We need real equality between men and women in political, economic and social life.
We have therefore voted against the report in its present form, as all the amendments we tabled were rejected. I would like to highlight the following:
the creation of support mechanisms for SME associations as a way of improving the competitiveness of SMEs and their level of organisation, as they can provide support services to association members, such as centralised credit, information and legal support services.
It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds, inadequate funds moreover, which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings.
I feel that it would be an appropriate gesture on your part, as the President of this Parliament, to appeal to President Khatami to, at the very least, suspend the death sentence passed on this Iranian student.
Back home we also have hot water, but at least it is good to have some water.
These are operational points which cannot be dismissed.
When the idea of the single market was launched with some vigour in the 1980s, we could still move towards our destination at the speed of a local steam locomotive, figuratively speaking.
The task of Lisbon has been correctly identified by you, Prime Minister, and by President Prodi as no less than shifting European policy towards a new practice, towards a new paradigm.
If we can give people jobs this will prove to be the greatest weapon in the fight against social exclusion.
On the eve of the Special Council dedicated to this problem, the basic question being asked is whether there is the political will to change this situation or whether, on the other hand, what we have is merely another ineffective initiative to add to the list of plans, strategies and summits in the past that have already been devoted to this issue and none of which has resulted in real change.
It is necessary because employment, and I mean quality employment with employee rights, is a fundamental right of every human being.
In the EU, it increased to 10.9%.
I think that in institutional terms, it is an extremely serious matter that we are moving towards replacing collegiate decisions, which the European Union is bound to observe under the Treaty, by means of bilateral decisions between governments.
Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to express my delight at the fact that a bullish agenda has been set for the issues of employment and economic development at the Lisbon Summit.
Some EU countries - mentioning no names - are struggling with high youth unemployment. In other countries - for example, in my own country, Denmark - youth unemployment is very low.
I would therefore advocate networking regions, more so than a Europe in which each Member State stands on its own dignity.
Economic reforms such as the liberalisation of the internal energy market have led to stiff competition and numerous mergers.
Despite satisfactory economic growth, the drop in unemployment is stagnating.
It is then far more sensible to find out why some countries or regions are doing so very badly, rather than saying that we are underperforming compared to the United States.
Another reason why I am saying this is that we ought to have something on the agenda in addition to comparisons with the United States. We must never for a moment forget that our greatest task in Europe is a healing one.
That sums up what we are trying to achieve on the e-side, the electronic side, of life.
But they alone will not give growth the stimulus it needs to enable long-lasting growth, effectively generating jobs, to be organised at a high level.
It is a global project, and while the notion of target groups may constitute a staging point, it cannot provide a solution to all our problems in terms of poverty and social exclusion.
In the new economy we want to give those people the opportunities to start businesses themselves; to go and work for the new growing businesses; to have more control over their working lives; to truly achieve their potential.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading (A5-0051/2000) by Mr Wijkman, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the Council common position for adopting a European Parliament and Council regulation on measures to promote the full integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries (12485/1/1999 - C5-0013/2000 - 1999/0020(COD)).
In spite of the fact that this is a document of several hundred pages, it is a programme which, in general, is well put together.
Here too, education and training measures need to be supported in order, in the end, to help people to help themselves.
The EU' s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries.
(DE) Mr President, I think you are mistaken!
Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Martín, you have certainly described very clearly what your report is all about.
It would seem to me absolutely essential to reflect on the scope of the regulation.
With reference to the amendments listed in the Fernández Martín report, the Commission's position on the main horizontal issues is as follows.
Amendment No 4 is considered acceptable.
I would therefore like to assure everyone that this is why it is sensible to opt for a system in which indirect costs are somehow absorbed in port dues.
But this is the crux of the matter and I wanted to draw everyone' s attention to it.
The first is in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not the experience of an individual state but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and it says that if a large proportion of the disposal costs is covered by the general port dues then there is obviously no incentive to dispose of the ship-generated waste at sea.
The other system is the pure polluter-pays principle: anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for doing so.
On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas.
Member States must also impose sanctions when these rules are broken.
Waste management facilities are to be built in ports and I believe this directive will definitely help considerably in limiting marine pollution.
I would ask for support for a more positive position, supplemented - I insist - with Amendment No 16 by Mr Sterckx, which would provide us with the necessary guarantees.
That is the equivalent to a medium-sized town being wiped off the face of the earth every year.
Time and again we are all severely shaken when there are major accidents which are due purely to technical defects.
You know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media.
The competent services have informed me that tomorrow' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy.
That said, we do not want to bureaucratise Europe and neither do we want to centralise it.
If you make these your goals, Mr President of the Commission, then we will be behind you every step of the way.
Exchanging lists in this way is not an ideal way to engage in dialogue. Therefore, in future, we should think of something different.
I would ask you, Mr President of the Commission, to put an assessment of your successes and failures at the head of your next programme, and to comment on the extent to which you have actually achieved that which you set out to do, so that we can both engage in dialogue which is improved, constructive and ideally suited to the purpose.
I came to this procedure as a relatively new Member of this House.
Indeed, to carry the metaphor further and using the English usage, if we were going to make a meal from these it would be rather long and rather indigestible.
Let me give one example of this.
The fundamental paradox is that the Union identifies itself as being more and more democratic, at the same time as democracy is being quite systematically cut back in our countries.
In our opinion, it is also essential that the Commission' s role be reinforced in the field of foreign policy.
They help in the analysis of non-military crises and help us to act on them quickly.
In Lisbon, should we not establish a sort of technological convergence criterion requiring Member States, for example, within a five year period, to move towards a rate of expenditure on research and development equivalent to at least 2.5% of their GDP? This is still less than the level currently attained by the United States?
The Commission President's speech this morning raises three concerns in my mind. The first relates to subsidiarity, where we feel strongly in our group, as the Liberals have just said, that we need to have a test for every single proposal put forward to show that it is in the European interest.
Lastly: the Commission' s Work Programme seems to overlook two sectors which are in need of particular attention from the European institutions, especially in the light of the developments constantly taking place in e-commerce.
This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community' s financial interests.
From the point of view of this Parliament, this type of arrangement cannot be allowed. We understand that the Commission has to be reformed.
This is not the first attempt to turn the Commission into a world-class public service, but we, Mr Prodi, wish to believe in the sincerity and resolve of your promise to this House.
Without that sort of protection people will not take the opportunity to live, move and work wherever they can within the European Union.
Let us do it in the new medium-term Social Action Programme.
Here too, Mr Prodi, I would like to sound the alarm, and I would call upon the Commission to put forward new measures which are properly suited to managing this type of crisis, in addition, obviously, to what you are already proposing, i.e. a solidarity fund.
The only thing I would ask is that you view my speech as just part of an overall debate which is taking shape day by day.
We may receive criticism, be limited in our actions and encounter technical setbacks, but we are breaking down the intellectual barriers of politics with this experiment.
And we asked for more precise measuring methods; in my opinion, the Ispra research institute has acquitted itself of this task quite admirably.
The Council' s common position as it is now before us attempts to accommodate all these interests.
Mr President, Commissioner, since we cannot reject the directive on chocolate which is, as it stands, unacceptable, Parliament is duty bound, at the very least, to improve it.
Once again we see the concept of profits for the few triumph over quality for all.
Let us put an end to this widespread dishonesty, where you begin with a product incorrectly described as chocolate and you end with a Commission incorrectly described as European, whose members are Americanically-modified organisms and whose standard is a flag of convenience concealing a globalist cargo.
Mr President, one of the joys of spending time in Belgium and France is the pleasure of these countries' chocolate.
In that way, you can still have both sorts of chocolate and choose which you want to buy according to personal taste or national tradition.
I think that is completely unnecessary.
No matter nowadays what the consumer wants, what the consumer' s preferences are, no matter the fact that public opinion wants ever greater transparency!
We are talking about harmonisation, the harmonisation of tastes, of habits and, almost, of cultures.
Any other sort of harmonisation would mean lowering standards and that is not the sort of Europe that the consumer wants.
In addition to this letter, further statements were made, which are false, insulting and which attempt to undermine the dignity and honour of a fellow Member of this House, who has, in the past, been an excellent President of a Member State of the European Union.
There are basically two reasons. One is that the deadline for a request for separate votes on the amendments should have been made by 7 p.m. yesterday.
Just to repeat what my colleague, Poul Nielson, stated yesterday, the Commission's position on the amendments is as follows.
The Charter represents a chance to build a modern post-national society, and marks a bold step forward from the sorrow and the pity of twentieth-century Europe.
They can also help individuals to take advantage of opportunities which are now arising in Europe through freedom of movement, the euro and information technology, that is to say the opportunities which are emerging in the new economy.
The old equal pay clause underlies a whole structure of equal treatment legislation which now forms part of the acquis communautaire.
The natural outcome of this determination is the inclusion of the future charter among the Treaties.
Needless to say, we need to do everything possible to leave national constitutions intact as much as possible but it cannot be ruled out that it will affect these constitutions.
Firstly, I should like to stress the need for the charter to develop the concept of European citizenship due to residence.
Finally, this charter would tend to circumvent the rights of communities, primarily the national community, which are rights that are extremely dear to the citizens, since it is within this circle that the most realistic and most legitimate democracy is expressed.
We do not, as yet, know what we will put inside it.
A meeting was proposed for the purpose of producing a Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European citizen.
Mr President, I would just like to say a few words on the question of the incorporation of the Charter into the Treaties.
There is however one risk.
I welcome the reference in our Charter to family life.
How far is the Union prepared to go?
It is obvious that the issue of incorporating the Charter of Fundamental Rights is a crucial factor for the whole credibility of the ICG.
Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.
My fellow Commissioners, Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Bolkestein, will inform you when the time comes regarding the various aspects of the Commission programme.
The Commission undertook to carry out clear, proactive work.
We are very happy to combat fraud and tax evasion and to improve social security legislation, but there are some points where there will be difficulty in convincing all the Member States to follow.
First of all, citizens who are very badly affected by non-intervention are mainly those who wish to enjoy free movement and, more specifically, cross-border workers.
As we exist right now, we could continue to operate more or less and to live together, but that is not what it is all about.
If it cannot have sovereignty over the territory, neither can it have sovereignty over its coastal waters.
What situation would the Government of the Western Sahara then be in with regard to the waters which it would have the sovereign duty to administrate?
We have supported action by national authorities, international organisations, and not least NGOs.
The funding of mine action from the geographic programmes and their budget lines will continue.
In addition, the PHARE and ISPA programmes are of course available in principle, which brings us to the question - to be answered in conjunction with the States concerned - as to how much money could be employed from these two funds.
Thereafter we will be able to start to think, as you wish, on the approach we might adopt with the Member States, who sometimes show some reluctance, and a European Parliament which will also have to be convinced, when the time comes, that we should go on to the second stage.
Is the export aid which has been made available by the French Government compatible with Article 92?
I should like to ask the Commissioner to clarify his answer.
This would be a clear distortion of the market.
Lastly, I must add that, in the case of drugs, control is more difficult, since the control systems are not so automatic nor so immediate as they are in the case of alcohol levels.
Of course, all of this is linked to our society and its development.
I would point out that the alternative project ATT3 - and I would like to thank Commissioner Kinnock and the chairman, Mr Coleman, for their efforts here - has been examined closely and in great detail by the Commission over the past two years, and I have also received a written report on this.
Those who argue the case for having only the one eco-labelling system are making a big mistake, I believe.
Eco-labelling is moving on from forest products and detergents to computers and household appliances, but why stop there?
The proposal for a revised Community programme for awarding the eco-label is mainly aimed at making the programme more effective and more open and at improving the methods used.
The Commission considers that these objectives will be fulfilled thanks to cooperation with, and interest on the part of, the European Parliament and the Council.
However, we need to bear in mind that, with this draft, we have deviated a long way from the first reading, in view of the fact that only untreated timber was then regarded as an acceptable exception.
As far as the continuous sampling of dioxins is concerned, this appears to be quite feasible.
Commissioner, waste management in Europe must undergo complete reform as a matter of urgency.
Incineration may increase as stricter controls are put on landfill, but it does not go hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste-disposal methods.
A great deal of waste is incinerated these days, but not, in fact, by these expensive installations equipped with flue-gas cleaning devices.
Mr President, the treatment of waste and the whole policy on waste is becoming an ever more important part of EU environmental policy.
The proposed directive on waste incineration goes to the heart of environmental legislation: the protection of public health.
Both directives constitute a firm basis for the sustainable treatment of the waste hierarchy, with improved preventative measures, better recycling and environmentally safe deposition of waste.
That is why I am sorry to see amendments tabled which reflect the Industry Committee's position.
We are aware of growing problems of ozone across Europe, but if we are not even prepared to match the standards being set by the USA, one of our great commercial rivals, this would indeed be a great shame and a sorry reflection on our commitment to environmental improvement.
I ask Parliament to support my proposals, to give its backing to the Commissioner and to let her play her part in negotiating a common position which is both ambitious and politically realistic.
There are no safe ozone levels, despite what the World Health Organisation claims.
This number is slightly lower than the proposal made by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection.
I am convinced that these two reports together provide a sound basis for positive developments in Europe in the fields of health and the environment.
Even if the Commission agrees that it is important to involve the Applicant States, there is no reason for reiterating this in a directive aimed at the Member States.
I note that, for example, my country, Belgium, has to meet the maximum possible level, rather than the economically viable level, but that, at the same time, areas in its vicinity which are just as polluted as my country can pursue a much laxer policy.
As I see it, the FFH directive is an instance where the legislation is not matched to the feasibilities of the regions.
In fact, it is a position in which I too find myself to some extent.
Commission procedures are under way against nearly every Member State - 12 Member States in fact - under the habitats directive at the moment.
In this regard I have proposed tomorrow two amendments to item 2 and item 3, adding a word: "to ensure that EU-funded programmes do not cause 'unauthorised' damage or destruction to actual or potential protected sites".
Mrs Maes, the issue you have raised will be studied by the Presidency and the Conference of Presidents immediately.
We saw a huge wave of refugees and, at the same time, we watched hospitals and embassies being bombed and unarmed civilians becoming the war targets, while the Balkan peninsular will pay the price and suffer the painful consequences of the ecological disaster caused by the bombings for years to come.
It makes no difference if people are destroyed in the name of a race or a class.
It must act preventatively within the scope of its foreign and security policy and its development policy and must react by applying sanctions, for example, by suspending assistance.
Democrats who gear their actions towards human rights, who want to include basic rights in their constitutions and apply them, must show that they are prepared to fight right-wing and left-wing extremism on the political battlefield so that there is no cause whatsoever for human rights to be infringed and I think that, here too, we must make it clear to all sides that, for us, human rights cannot be used to justify a specific political system to a greater or lesser degree, and that it is the individual rights of the people which are at stake here, that it is human dignity which is at stake here and that, for this reason, political motives are no excuse for infringing human rights in any manner or at any stage of development.
Mr President, President of the Council, I welcome the statement of the Council this morning and while I endorse the sentiments expressed by the President, we should ask the question: what are the EU and its Member States doing to give expression to these laudable principles?
This is especially the case if it is a question of internal conflicts.
It was precisely this question of providing normal access to humanitarian organisations that was the focal point of my visit to Chechnya at the beginning of February.
the annual report (A5-0050/2000) by Mr Haarder, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on respect for human rights in the European Union (1998-1999) [11350/1999 - C5-0265/1999 - 1999/2001(INI)];
This work has become even more important as time has gone by.
Certain basic rights are universal.
We must work more systematically to collect and evaluate data, information and background material. We need an early warning system for violations of human rights.
The issue must be dealt with in diplomatic relations and raised with the candidate countries in the course of the negotiations relating to the enlargement of the EU.
I think that Bosnia and Kosovo have taught us all that national minorities constitute the most potentially explosive factor in the Europe of the future.
Quite the opposite, in fact: a common social threat requires a common, political effort.
It is the most extreme versions of racism on the edges of Europe which we are disturbed about.
That situation is improving, but ultimately we have institutions which are bereft of representation.
This is a precision weapon, which must be utilised more.
Denouncing racism, including racist talk, does not mean censoring the freedom of opinion as some would have us believe. Racism is not an opinion.
There is also another type of racism which involves daily harassment and humiliation.
The Netherlands has adopted such a policy over the past couple of years, aimed at bringing about a multi-cultural society.
In a great many societies, the woman is still suffering at the hands of men as a result of institutionalised and sometimes legalised misuse of power.
Firstly, to abandon all hypocrisy and treat all countries in the same way; secondly, to commit ourselves to defending, at all costs, human rights everywhere, including in the economic field, in factories; thirdly, to show a special concern for human rights throughout the world, in Latin America (in Mexico, in Argentina, in Peru) etc.; fourthly, to accept unreservedly the cause of human rights for women; and lastly, to recommend the ratification of the International Criminal Court.
Who knows where it will all end.
In the same way, full citizenship implies giving third country nationals resident in the European Union the right to vote in all elections.
I just wonder what that has to do with human rights.
We need consistency, patience and a well thought-out strategy for turning noble words into concrete action that leads to results.
This is not, as some have tried to claim, an issue affecting only a few people; it goes to the heart of the European Union's commitment to respect the Convention on Human Rights, to its own Treaties and to the rule of law.
He deserves it.
We heard a few moments ago a disgraceful speech from Mr Gollnisch on behalf of his party.
People within their own communities therefore suffer.
We are Haiders when, to give the minor example of an incident which took place in Rome last week, Bosnian Roma refugees are deported with the approval of the mayor and sent back without aid to places of conflict; children and mothers, brothers and sisters separated, without even the time to gather together any belongings to take with them; children born in Italy snatched away from their schools where they have become integrated and made good friends with the other pupils.
Mr President, I should like to concentrate mainly on certain aspects of the Belder report, which contains an excellent analysis of the current situation in the candidate countries.
I will therefore put this to the House.
Madam President, please note that the French socialists in the House will not take part in the vote as we consider that the tabled motion is not impartial.
I am therefore not happy about this.
Will the new text at least allow the consumer to easily distinguish between true and imitation chocolate?
Since 1992, the Euro-Flower logo has become a hallmark of environmentally-friendly products, ranging from washing machines to writing paper.
Britain is already well on the way to achieving its target of cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010.
This is why our concerns focus on the emissions of heavy metals, dioxins and furanes.
In addition, the generalised use of this hazardous waste must not lead to the production of this waste becoming acceptable.
There is unanimous support for this position across all the fifteen Member States of the European Union.
If the same requirements are laid down for all types of incineration plant, the effect could be to hinder the sorting of rubbish and to make recycling and reuse more difficult, including composting organic waste.
However, I believe that some countries are not prepared for this either practically or theoretically.
This means that the workforce has to adapt to the new information technologies.
This House is prepared to exercise diplomatic restraint in many areas, but not on this question.
A number of proposed amendments by Baroness Ludford attempt to rectify this and I shall support them.
Antisemitism is, without doubt, widespread; often it is latent, which complicates the issue.
Madam President, even to a slightly unprejudiced eye, there is clearly no trace of racism down the broad middle of this House.
There should be a broad consensus on this in this House.
Madam President, both I and my Group enthusiastically support Mr Haarder' s human rights report because we have found a very good line in it and there are numerous reasons for doing so.
It is absurd that some states, including, sadly, my native country, are being condemned by the European Court of Human Rights over the exaggerated length of their legal proceedings.
Mr President, I am in favour of the Haarder report in its entirety, including paragraph 38, and I am therefore departing from the line of the Group of the Party of European Socialists to which I belong, for I feel that the four points mentioned in paragraph 38 - the excessive length of time for which people are remanded in custody, the excessive length of time taken to complete trials, failure to separate the careers of investigating magistrates and judges and the risk of politically influenced magistrates dealing with politicians in public enquiries - are all matters for careful reflection which should lead us to vote for this motion.
In some cases there has been agreement with the form but probably not with the content. In any case, I think that these four reports are, overall, extremely important and that they raise highly topical issues for all of us, especially at a time when the European Union, both internally and as regards its role on the world stage, is endeavouring to highlight and give substance to a fundamental set of values which will ultimately act as a catalyst for its own political union.
We will look, in the Commission, at ways in which we can contribute to the search for a solution.
Moving on to more general issues, I mentioned the forthcoming communication on human rights and external relations.
Those who implement the projects may even see their own rights threatened, which is no doubt why NGOs often feel a little aggrieved that they then have to provide the Commission with a shoebox full of receipts when they return to the office.
The European Union's financial procedures, including the financial regulation are, to put it mildly, not NGO-friendly, which begs the question: should we stop funding NGOs or should we change our procedures?
The former is clearly as impossible as it would be totally undesirable.
We have a backlog of projects to complete and we have underspent the human rights budget in the past so I would find it very difficult to justify an increase in spending until we have sorted this out.
They are issues of increasing concern to European Union citizens as they are daily assailed by media footage of human rights abuses, whether they be in the Caucasus, Colombia, the Balkans, Sierra Leone, China and so on.
I am grateful to Parliament for its timely input.
I am particularly looking forward to working with Members of this Parliament to ensure that the communication we produce later this year gives an intellectual and political lead on this issue and can be regarded by NGOs, parliamentarians and others as blazing a trail for discussion of these fundamental issues.
My third comment, if you will allow, is addressed to you, Mr da Costa: what happens in one country of the European Union is of interest to the other countries, that is perfectly obvious.
The motives here were different, however, and voters simply overwhelmingly voted the old government and Socialism out in favour of an alternative.
Madam President, Mr Pirker has not spoken on the agenda. Clever as he is, he has taken cover under a point of order to give a short, two-and-a-half minute speech as to what we must forgive him for as an Austrian who also comes from Carinthia.
In addition, I would like to remind you that all the Justice and Home Affairs Council' s proposals on this matter have been presented to this House, which has, in fact, given its opinion on this matter on three occasions: 15 January 1998, 18 March 1999 and 11 November 1999.
There is also an absence of clarity in the definition of the illegal immigrants to whom the regulation will apply.
Indeed, even the export of dead bovines is still being blocked in certain countries because although the ban on the export of beef from the UK was lifted on 1 August 1999, it is, as we all know, still being illegally maintained by France and Germany to this very day.
I am firmly committed to the notion that Parliament will have full scrutiny of Commission proposals in circumstances where the legal structures of the European Union, that is the Treaty and the directive, allow for that situation.
Furthermore, adopting this amendment would mean further delaying the legislative procedure which could otherwise be concluded after the first reading.
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.
Does the Council concur with that statement?
If not, does it intend to launch the procedures referred to in Article 7?
I never said that the Austrian Government is a racist government, let me make that quite clear.
I personally do not like sitting alongside fascists.
If the Council is not in possession of such information, does it not agree that steps need to be taken to establish a system for keeping proper records of these cases? What action does it intend to take to remedy this lack of information?
We will therefore, in due course, be able to give a concrete reply to this question, and to obtain specific and up-to-date information, but this will naturally depend on progress made with the consular cooperation that the European Union is trying to build up.
This cannot be due to lack of time because I asked this question to the Council three months ago and it did not reply in writing.
I know that we require the commitment of the Member States, but do you not think that what we basically need is a political will which, until now, I have not seen from any quarter?
Furthermore, a Council Decision on improving the provision of information relating to the Council's legislative activities and the public register of Council documents was approved.
With regard to your question about this disagreement between Parliament and the Commission, it is obvious that the Council would be the last institution to get involved in this disagreement and will leave those two institutions to sort out this potential argument between them.
Mr President, this is the third debate on the EU-Mexico agreement and, given that it is the most comprehensive agreement which the European Union has ever concluded with a third country, the principles that mark the sort of cooperation which will be viable in the future should not be thrown to the wind.
Placing no limit on opening public procurement merely allows large suppliers to swallow up small suppliers all over the world.
Here is another shortcoming in comparison with NAFTA: the latter has an agreement on employees' rights with a sanction mechanism, while the EU agreement has not even heard of the Social Pact of the United Nations.
We now have conflicting evidence revealing an increase in violations of human rights, supplied not only by civil society but also by UN representatives and officials, by Mary Robinson herself, by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and by many other sources.
We are not going just for institutional dialogue between partners, between the Congress and the European Parliament.
We have amendments about consumer protection - so important in the establishment of trust in e-commerce - on the future of taxation, on the implications for healthcare and for transport.
One of these is in Rutland, the smallest county in England, where a virtual Rutnet was set up, bringing together people in rural, isolated communities for purposes of leisure, transport, employment and social life generally.
We naturally applaud the Commission' s aim of making the information society benefit all sectors and all regions but now, with the Commissioner here, we also have the opportunity to consider the citizens' viewpoint and remind the Commission and the public that rhetoric in announcing objectives and expressing desires is not enough. We want these words transformed as firmly as possible into specific objectives and precise financial commitments, because that is the only way to get a real strategy covering every aspect of the information society.
However, caution is required in the legislative area in that we must not over-regulate; in other words, the first question with future legislative proposals should always be, do we actually need this?
The rest of us should start a counter-revolution.
Finally I would like to say that I support the introduction of benchmarking with regard to the development of the information society.
That is why the proposal in this report, according to which resources for education and learning would be made available, is so important.
Secondly: how will our working life and employment relations change?
We need to consider if we need new joint-decision structures in the face of these revolutionary developments, new structures for listening to employees and making decisions.
This goal, in my view, does not justify the concerns raised here about a possible division in society between the haves and have-nots as far as access to information is concerned.
Today we are to vote on this resolution, which is why we are asking for a vote on the work done in committee.
You will find exactly the same arguments I have put forward today in the Minutes of the committee meeting and in my amendments.
Would the rapporteur be so kind as to inform us whether his version is the authentic version, for, if so, the meaning is the complete opposite to the Italian.
We will vote on these measures either this evening or on Friday. This appears to us to be a political manoeuvre to influence the majorities in this Chamber.
There is absolutely no problem with that.
It can be done immediately before the vote.
First of all, a few months ago, we discovered, tucked away in the Cologne conclusions, in paragraphs 44 and 45, the decision to start drafting a Charter of Fundamental Rights.
Of course, some people will say this was merely a new formulation of existing rights, but it is clear that this operation will go much further, with the European Parliament already calling for an innovative Charter.
So the national parliaments find themselves sidelined and replaced by a body of officials who will 'proclaim the Charter' .
If we nonetheless choose to vote in favour of the whole report, that is because we believe that fundamental human rights are one of the foundations upon which the EU is built and because we want a Charter concerning these to be drawn up in the form of a political document.
At the same time, human rights must be regarded as an international and global issue and not only as a matter for EU citizens.
I do not take the view that this charter should contain enforceable economic and social rights.
Indeed, the Commissioner, in a response to the debate, said she would not be stopping approval of key funding programmes.
It is unacceptable for the Commission only to take a lukewarm interest in a country which probably has no mineral resources, which, in terms of human rights, is doing a relatively good job in the region, which is small and very much agriculture-based.
Many of us do not support the abolition of capital punishment in principle.
However, I and a majority in my Group voted against the report because points 52 - 56 contain quite controversial social policy requirements which may well be supported by the left wing of this House but which have nothing to do with human rights.
I am therefore able to tell the House that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have valid passports without any form of restriction.
Among others, it is calling for equal rights of all kinds between same-sex couples and the traditional family, together with lowering the age of consent for same-sex relations.
May I just remind you that Article 16 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that "the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the State" .
Our European Parliament has a vital role to play in the formulation and practical application of EU human rights policy.
That Europe affirms the primacy of a principle not found in the Haarder report, the secular principle, which contains and synthesises all the other freedoms: right to respect for private life, freedom of conscience and religion, freedom of expression and association.
Alas, the 2000 vintage still goes along with this curious tradition.
Only then can we effectively and consistently ban human cloning or discrimination on the basis of genetic inheritance, a discrimination suffered far too often by, for instance, Down' s syndrome babies, in the name of what seem to be the best of intentions.
Meanwhile, the situation of the Sahrawi people has become serious: even their physical survival is under threat.
Mr President, the media have portrayed a distorted image of the disaster which struck Mozambique.
This will result in disbursements for this purpose estimated at EUR 150 m this year as compared to EUR 100 m last year.
These visitors appealed to us to understand that, in their words, Russia was fighting against terrorism and was not waging a real war, and that this fight against terrorism had been exacerbated by outside arms flows and training camps sponsored by predatory nations jealous of Russia' s power.
There has been a certain amount of one-sided thinking in them here and there, which has not made them any more effective.
I am in favour of this.
It is most peculiar that the European Union is not really aware that we too have this tool at our disposal and that, for example, we should, in fact, deny entry to the EU to the Serbian football hooligans in return, because they are people who take advantage of the Milosevic regime in the most shocking manner.
Mr President. Over a year ago, in February 1999, there was hope for new relations between India and Pakistan.
We hope that substantial decisions similar to those proposed in Tampere will be taken regarding the creation of common investigation groups, a European police academy and a genuine European judiciary such as EUROJUS.
The number of inquiries against cigarette smuggling even increased in 1998, although the financial impact was lower than in the previous years.
I am against ethnic classifications, because that would stigmatise immigrants.
(Applause)
Now this Parliament, as co-legislator, should know that any statement it makes has either legal value or, as in this case, quasi-legal value, and that is why greater care must be taken.
It is badly drafted.
We would have preferred a statement in keeping with the European Parliament' s resolution on Austria.
Coming back to Austria, one reason why it has come to this extreme situation is perhaps that this country does not have a sufficiently objective memory of the past.
Report (A5-0055/2000) by Mr Belder
In fact, the European Central Bank will probably close its 1999 financial year with a deficit of more than EUR 200 million.
We want the ECB to be able to pursue its main objective of safeguarding price stability in total independence - including material independence.
At the same time, and here Mr Duisenberg is being too evasive for my liking, we also want the European System of Central Banks to give its unequivocal support to the European Union' s general economic policies.
The Central Bank has everything to gain from this improved transparency with regard to consolidating its credibility.
So its role is not just to satisfy the expectations of the financial markets.
Aside from a few technical explanations relating to details, such as the exact number of ECB staff, there is only one valid reason that can be cited: the euro-optimism surrounding the launch of the euro, as it was called at the time, led people to believe that the single currency would naturally be strong and that the question of reserves was, therefore, secondary.
Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting
In our opinion, the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000.
However, another negative aspect of the Commission' s proposal relates to limiting cofinancing to a rate of 75%, when actions implemented directly by the Commission are financed at a rate of 100%.
Finally, we are talking about Community protection for a crop which last year, in my region, provided an honest living for around 17 000 families.
Grain legumes are not covered by the aid scheme that was remodelled with the Agenda 2000 programme, although they can be used in crop rotation schemes involving other crops such as corn.
There are two conclusions to be drawn from this.
However, these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party.
What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission?
What are they actually trying to achieve?
But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues - additionality and cofinancing.
I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again, that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island.
Because of the Labour Government's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year, it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects.
I request that Mr Barnier gives a written summary of his response to these points.
The chairman of the Canadian delegation suddenly launched into the most obnoxious personal attacks upon myself, for no reason whatsoever, to the point that the other members of his delegation spoke up to disassociate themselves from his words.
I should also mention an interest of my own since I am a professor of the University on unpaid leave of absence from that institution which is also involved.
Indeed it was our former fellow Member, Mrs Ewing, whom I must welcome more particularly, who opened the first sitting of the Scottish Parliament.
I can assure you, Mr Campos, that the interaction that takes place at Commission level on these issues puts a high premium on food safety.
My question is this: how can we protect our farmers as producers if, in the final analysis, they do not know what they are feeding their animals and are then held liable?
We propose to test a minimum number of 65 000 animals per year in the whole Community, and the testing will start in January 2001.
I was at a seminar in Dublin as recently as last weekend discussing these issues with the chief veterinary officers of the European Union and with the Food and Veterinary Office.
This is, of course, a difficult issue to discuss sensibly in a United States election year.
Our position, then, is as follows:
Their future commitment depends on whether or not we are willing to defer.
It is about how we put into practice the Treaty of Amsterdam on integrating sustainability concerns into all policy areas, even the very difficult ones.
It offends against the fundamental requirement for reasons under Article 253 of the Treaty in that there is no explanation at all in the regulation for the use of the bypass ratio of an aircraft engine as a criteria when internationally approved noise and emissions standards certification for aircraft engines already exist.
We therefore welcome the major step taken by Parliament in deciding, through the Presidents of the Groups, to convene the Interparliamentary Forum.
To this end, we propose that Summits of the Heads of State and Government of the Mediterranean countries of the European Union should be held regularly, and that the role of the special envoy for the Middle East should be consolidated, so that we do not relinquish the political role we desire to the United States.
The need for a different, more efficient Mediterranean policy for the developing countries in the Basin cannot be disregarded.
With regard to the economic and financial partnership, in addition to creating a free trade area by 2010, would the Commission specify the actions it intends to promote in the countries concerned in order to accomplish the objectives of macroeconomic stabilisation and the process of liberalisation and privatisation, to simplify laws and to consolidate social policies.
Investment is a major issue which was addressed at the important conference held in Lisbon on 29 February and 1 March.
The SMART Programme on the environment, the Cultural Heritage Programme, the EUROMED Youth Programme and MEDA Democracy, for example.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in Barcelona we signed with due formality the Charter for the Mediterranean which we had ensured would focus on the rule of law and human rights.
We should therefore tell those countries where human rights are not observed that bilateral relations may be forced backwards, and we should tell the countries where there is real progress, such as in Morocco or elsewhere, that bilateral relations may go forwards.
Not the opponents of the regime.
Our nations will remain great powers in the next century only insofar as they have successfully met the challenge of the Mediterranean partnership.
This would be absolutely incredible or, at least, very naive.
I believe that there are some people that we should not even speak to on principle.
Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mr Hernández Molar for the excellent work that he has done on this report and for the spirit of cooperation with which he has sought an all-party consensus behind his recommendations.
Clearly it is not easy at present to make suitable proposals for Iraq which might have some chance of being implemented, given the current political situation.
The report now gives us the opportunity to develop a new basis on which to evaluate the work of the High Level Working Group and my group therefore supports the rapporteur.
According to the United Nations High Commissioner for refugees, 93 000 people applied for sanctuary in the United Kingdom last year.
We must draw up a medium-term personnel plan in order to meet the huge challenge of the enlargement of the European Union.
The committee also wants to reiterate its support for continued financial assistance to NGO participation in much of the technical committee work of the Parliament and the Commission.
We need to be imaginative about how we address the issues of staffing and building requirements.
We cannot go on like this. Finally, I would stress the need to restructure the budget - for example, we could axe TAOs - and thus secure new resources.
We have therefore introduced an amendment to cover this.
Of course, the programme financed by the Structural Funds is one of the most important instruments for promoting employment.
I had a good opportunity to get to know you really well and found that the Committee on Budgets was a very robust committee with excellent staying powers.
Each of us knows of cases of child abuse in our own country.
The law of the offenders' country of origin must be binding for the purposes of criminal prosecution.
It is our duty to this generation which represents our future, a generation which expects us to protect and respect it.
Mr President, confronted with the worrying development of sex tourism and, more generally, the sexual exploitation of children in Europe and throughout the world, Mrs Klamt is quite right to put forward measures in her report which are adequate to deal with the serious problem before us.
Finally, I must alert the House to the latest developments.
Combating child sex tourism offers the Commission an opportunity to enlist its various services to step up internal coordination. It also affords the Commission the opportunity to step up its cooperation with the national administrations, professional associations and non-governmental organisations involved.
We would like you to evaluate the reports which you receive impartially.
The traditional push towards harmonisation has been the internal market to which we can now add the aspirations of Tampere for a single area of European justice.
It is a truism that European law has been able to benefit from the ability to draw on rich comparative material of varying legal traditions in our different Member States.
It must have ambitious, clearly defined objectives at European level in the order of those given in the Commission White Paper, i.e. 12% for energy and 23% for electricity.
It is true, of course, that the countries with feed-in systems have made a great deal of progress, but that is not on account of the feed-in system but because of the financing which is in place there.
Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur on being open to dialogue on all areas connected to the report and to the amendments.
I personally come from Upper Austria and, at present, Upper Austria has broken the energy-saving and energy-renewing records.
This is what we will do, which does not mean that, in five years time, there should not be a review of the different systems and that we should not commit ourselves to those which have proved to be the most effective and which have resulted in greater development of renewable energies in those countries.
In any event, as you know, on 2 December 1999, in the Energy Council, I gave a questionnaire to the Member States, so I could see what stage we had reached, what stage the issue had reached, and so I could present a directive that could obtain sufficient consensus to quickly conclude its passage through both Parliament and the Council.
Madam President, I think anyone reading page 6 of the Minutes might get the wrong impression from the juxtaposition of my speech and Mr Vander Taelen' s.
(The Minutes were approved)
It cannot gather this data directly. I will clarify this for you.
What we have here is not Huxley' s "brave new world" taking shape, but merely industrial espionage.
Here, there have been programmes for eighteen months.
Some oppositions to this patent have already been filed.
But the Office assures me that proceedings will speedily lead to conclusions, subject to respecting the rights of the parties to be heard.
Whatever our attitude to abortion, even those of us who consider abortion to be lawful have always agreed on one point: the right of the mother prevails over the right of the embryo, but the right of the embryo does exist. It yields solely and exclusively before the right of the mother, not before the right of a multinational to make money.
I want this part to be removed and I want to give notice of the fact now, before we proceed to the vote.
This industry also generates numerous land-based jobs, in the processing industry and in the dockyards.
Voices have been rightly raised in this very House against the dictatorship that holds sway in Tunisia and the one that continues to rule in Morocco, even if it is more moderate.
Hernández Mollar report (A5-0057/2000)
I abstained on the final vote on this report on the basis of my speech on Wednesday evening.
Clearly, with new technology and globalisation, child pornography on the Internet, in particular, is an ever-growing international problem.
Progress is, of course, being made.
However, it is precisely the subject of renewable energy sources that must be freed from the burden of ideology and wishful thinking, as well as from the material misuse of energy sources themselves.
That does not prevent me and my group from campaigning, in the future too, for a situation in which ethical limits upon medical research and therapy are all complied with.
There are so many uncertainties at the legal and moral level, about the future acceptability of patents applied for, which are currently in the thousands.
Thank you, Mr Imbeni, for your extremely kind words.
Madam President, if I have been informed correctly, the Council has postponed its statement on Iraq and it will not now be made this week.
Madam President, we have read in the newspapers that five million euros' worth of Parliament property has been purloined and that Parliament' s finances have been poorly managed.
As elected members of our national parliaments, we represent our electorate and this must be reflected in all votes. However, the agenda for Fridays, for this Friday and for previous Fridays, is often so light that many MEPs genuinely believe that they can spend their time more productively in their own countries.
We have no means to force the Council to make a statement.
We must not, therefore, simply act in a preventative fashion; we must offer long-term help to those children affected.
This correlation is also evident in the case of possibly kidnapped and missing children. Recently, mothers recognised their own children on a porn website which could be viewed at police stations in France.
This state of affairs makes it essential to draw up a survey of paedophile networks within the countries of the European Union.
The Internet, as evidenced by child pornography, presents totally new challenges to our subjective, individual sense of responsibility.
Tourist areas, also within our own European Union, do not want to admit that poverty forces poor children into prostitution.
This is why all public post-boxes should be closed and it should only be possible to send letters at the post-office following official verification of ID.
How we deal with the dispossessed is an issue for society as a whole, not just for governments.
It could, in itself, contribute towards the common policy based on best practices.
They campaigned against Denmark' s joining the single currency, which we are to vote on in September, and they have been on the "no" side in four out of the five previous Danish referenda.
The allocation criteria, which are based on the average number of asylum applicants and recognised refugees and the nature of the projects, are perhaps not adequate to achieve a fair distribution of the burden.
Are Member States themselves no longer capable of managing the refugees they receive in normal circumstances?
The monetary stability control of the ECB is based on the founding treaties of the EC and it should not be expanded through the provisions of EC directives.
In this latter case the additional words would add nothing and be misleading to the consumer.
The introduction of the Euro will undoubtedly have a positive effect and will mean that the time has also come for us to establish uniform regulations to safeguard electronic commerce.
What we have here is an attempt, when we see that a particular theory of monetary control is not working and does not accord with reality, to squeeze that reality back into the theory, to the detriment of the innovatory capacity of the Member States and of their financial systems.
Animal nutrition inspections
In the light of the plenary's support for the amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I will press once more on the Council the strong case for supporting the proposal's original provisions.
I am thinking in particular of the problem of allergies.
It must be acknowledged that, in the course of time, technological need has always been the predominant criterion.
The rapporteur claims that there is a risk of contaminants in ethylhydroxyethylcellulose that could have a carcinogenic effect and also suggests that high doses could have a laxative effect.
Why should we make life even more difficult for these families?
.
The fact that this motion was tabled in the form of a compromise between the four main groups demonstrates clearly that Parliament is pulling in the same direction on this extremely important issue and wishes to signal its unity over and above party political divisions and any national interests or chauvinism.
It still causes Parliament some concern that the jobs have not yet been filled and that it is extremely difficult to do so.
Consequently, the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has requested the Court of Auditors to carry out a thorough investigation into the legality and lawfulness of payments in research as a matter of high priority.
Firstly, certain measures dating back to before 1989 have still not been completed.
The Court of Auditors did not grant the Commission an auditor' s certificate establishing that payments had been implemented in a lawful and proper manner.
As the Commissioner for the Budget, I subscribe fully to the opinion that, in some areas, the shortcomings in the implementation of the budget are simply unacceptable.
But we need a procedure which safeguards the confidentiality of information and, more importantly, the principle of the rule of law whereby people cannot be pre-judged.
A few words now on Mr Casaca' s report.
If the Council had any concern about budget control, we certainly would not be sitting in this building right now.
It is not enough to say that it should come down.
National states support all kinds of Third Way movements, so does Europe.
It is true that the explanatory note to the resolution reads much like a piece of crime fiction. It contains scandals which are now out in the open about waste, nepotism, theft, the Fléchard affair, the ECHO affair and such like, not to mention the direct involvement of Commissioner Cresson.
Mr Prodi' s Commission is not responsible for the sins of the past, but all 20 Commissioners are now responsible for the fact that procedures have not been cleaned up and put in order and a fresh start made.
Admit that you will be replaced if you continue to sweep the dirt under the carpet.
It is not a question of the popping of champagne corks between Brussels and Strasbourg, that is an irrelevance if I might put it politely.
I come to two points here.
Therefore we, as a Parliament, should look at each of these cases as it stands.
Secondly, you must ensure that the people responsible for mismanagement and erroneous developments are punished consistently, if necessary by making them compensate for part of the damage caused out of their own pocket.
But the small parties too which have mismanaged the party funding have once again put our name in a bad light.
These should be the exception, but we have noticed that in 1998, 50% of the cases were awarded privately.
The Stauner report deserves every support on this score.
This debate must not concentrate excessively on the accounting issues.
I also think it is a good idea to look a little more closely at the discharge for the development fund.
The main focus is the reform of internal auditing in each of the institutions.
According to the budget, this investigation will be given to an independent expert.
It complained about the pre-dating of contracts and a high overall error rate in payment audits due to incorrect proof of or information on costs, an error rate for which the Commission is perhaps not 100% responsible, but is at least 90% responsible.
Some people have criticised it for being a bit too severe.
You will be aware that the Leonardo programme has played an extremely important role in the events which have led to the previous Commission resigning from office.
I can only say in this context that the procedure changed with the legal basis for OLAF.
This is why the rapporteur proposes reintroducing this clause, and I am pleased to see it because without this clause there is no guarantee of consumer protection in food crisis situations.
The report clearly expresses consumer concerns in the face of the flood of additives, of chemicals, into our daily diet.
This proposal is a step in this direction and I can therefore only give it my support.
Mr President, creating this European Refugee Fund is the very least that could be done to face up to the reception of refugees and forcibly displaced persons likely to enter European Union territory.
